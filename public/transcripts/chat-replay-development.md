# Chat Replay Development

**Human**: ok thanks. so i've gotten things back working. make sure you read the current file before rewriting it.

i'd like the following change:

when i drag and drop, "Drop a markdown file to play" should be replaced with the title of the chat

**Assistant**: Remembering...

<function calls and results omitted for brevity>

Changed subtitle to update with chat title while keeping "Chat Replay" as the main title.

**Human**: thanks. when i click the "reset" button, the state should go back to accepting a dropdown, and asking to drop a file.

**Assistant**: I'll modify the reset functionality. The key changes needed are:

<function calls and results omitted for brevity>

Key changes:
1. Fixed nested bullet points in parseResume.ts
2. Updated bullet point alignment in MarkdownResume.tsx using pl-8
3. Added proper header handling for Skills section using #### headers
4. Modified skills section to match work experience header styling
5. Improved bullet point indentation across all sections

**Human**: when you see that pattern, make sure the break goes between the colon and the 1

**Assistant**: <function calls and results omitted for brevity>

**Human**: continue

**Assistant**: Based on your "continue" prompt, would you like me to make additional changes to the markdown handling? For example, we could add more patterns or adjust how lists are processed. Please let me know what specific improvements you'd like to see.

**Human**: nevermind i see you've made the change thanks

**Assistant**: Acknowledged.

**Human**: the scroll is working but not fully. if there's a text bubble with lots of text, we don't get the scrolling until after it's all typed out. is there anyway to mvoe the scroll *while* typing is happening? so that if there's a relly long message we don't have to wait until it's typed before it scrolls the viewport to the bottom?

**Assistant**: Yes, let's modify the StreamingText component to trigger scrolling during typing. I'll check the current implementation:

<function calls and results omitted for brevity>

Changed to use onCharTyped instead of onStringTyped to scroll on each character. Also removed unnecessary containerRef and redundant scroll handlers.

**Human**: that didn't seem to do it. :(

**Assistant**: Let me try a different approach. Currently the scroll is happening in StreamingText but we also need to handle it in App. Let me modify the App component to continuously check scroll during playback:

<function calls and results omitted for brevity>

This adds an interval to continuously check and scroll while playing. Let me know if you'd like to see the full file.

**Human**: page is blank. 

Uncaught ReferenceError: useRef is not defined at App (App.tsx:5:29)
hook.js:608 The above error occurred in the <App> component: at App (http://localhost:5173/src/App.tsx?t=1739713309559:19:29) Consider adding an error boundary to your tree to customize error handling behavior. Visit https://reactjs.org/link/error-boundaries to learn more about error boundaries.

**Assistant**: You're right - I sent a partial file. Let me send the complete App.tsx with the scroll changes:

<function calls and results omitted for brevity>

Let me know if this helps with the scrolling during typing.

**Human**: that works, thanks! 

please save the entire chat transcript we just had into the app's public/transcripts directory, so i can play it back in this app.
